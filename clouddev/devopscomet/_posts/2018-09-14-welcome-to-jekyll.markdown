This is the first post and arguable the most embarrising becuase I haven't a clue what I'm at yet but that's the aim, to learn as much as I possibly can about the DevOps universe. The initail journey will start easy and my second post will be a description of how this blog was created and the steps required, and automating as much as possible.  

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  print("Hi" ,name}"
end
{% endhighlight %}

See you soon!
