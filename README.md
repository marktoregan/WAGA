## Watts Available Genetic Algorithm

This is my final year project for CIT cloud masters program.

We are currently living through peak oil with 99.3 million barrels of crude oil being
produced each day, it is predicted that this amount will start to drop dramatically
over the next 30 years. As a society we are have a huge challenge ahead and very likely
facing the possibility of having to switch from petrol cars to electric cars. This trend
is being encouraged by global governments through incentives and by car companies
who are producing a variety of electric vehicles (EVs). The challenge with electric
vehicles is that they require a charging station to refill the battery and this takes a
considerable amount of time. As the number of electric vehicles increases on the roads
so will the demand for charging points. This project seeks to tackle congestion at
charging stations by optimizing the allocation of charging points to electric vehicles on
a journey, essentially each EV is competing for a limited resource the charge point.
A genetic algorithm apply the evolutionary methods of fitness, selection crossover and
mutation to search for optimal solutions. Itâ€™s an iterative process where each generation
is an improvement on the previous one. By applying this algorithm it is hoped that the
minimal time spent at charging stations can be found.
